# SSL Certificates Directory

Place your SSL certificates here:
- cert.pem (SSL certificate)
- key.pem (Private key)

## Development (Self-Signed)

Generate self-signed certificate for testing:
```bash
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout nginx/ssl/key.pem \
  -out nginx/ssl/cert.pem \
  -subj "/CN=localhost"
```

## Production (Let's Encrypt)

Certificates are managed by certbot and stored in Docker volume `certbot-etc`.
No manual copying needed.

## Security

⚠️ Never commit real certificates to git!
This directory is in .gitignore.
